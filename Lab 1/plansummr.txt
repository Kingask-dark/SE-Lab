To solve this problem First i will make 2 functions for claclution of Mean and Standard Deviation
formula for Mean

mean = sum of all number / total number of item

formula for Standard Deviation 
 
standard deviation = squareroot(sumof(x-mean)^2/n-1)

To Test i will make 2 function where i pass the input  array of n real number along with their mean and standard deviation.

Inorder to develop the program i write code to calculate mean and then reuse the vlaue of mean to calculate the standard deviation

after analysing i came to the estimates 
main function	10
mean function	10
standard deviation function	10
test mean function	10
test standard deviation function	10

test data prepration 	
i assume an array of size 4 {1,2,3,4} mean = 2.5 sd = 1.11
{5,6,7,8} mean = 6.5 sd = 1.11
{-2,-4,9,3} mean = 1.5 sd = 5.02
