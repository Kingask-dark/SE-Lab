Here I use Javascript (Node Js) for coding the problem.

In order to solve this problem i first create a data.txt file which contain all the neccessary data required for this problem.
And then i create a data.js file where i first import path from path which is used to get all the paths needed for this program. And then i import file system (fs with promises) to perform operations related to the file system.

And after importing i then start coding all the logic needed for this project.Then i created a fileops function to handle all the operations. And i  will keep the output generated from the program in array. 

And for the test part i will first create a txt file which contains actual output for the file and create a testops function and use fs with promise to read the actual output and store it in array and check whether the output data of array and the actual output are same or not.

after analysing i came to the estimates

-> creating data.txt file  							 5 min
-> Importing necessary packages/modules				 	 5 min
-> creating objects for employee customers 		     		 30 min
-> creating array of output data						 10 min
-> testing the data 								 30 min


-> lines of code to import required packages/modules    		 2 lines
-> lines of codes for creating employee object           		 5 lines
-> lines of codes for creating customers object         		 5 lines
-> lines of code for creating transactions logic       		 15 lines
-> lines of code for creating array of output data			 5 lines
-> lines of code for reading actual output file and			 8 lines
creating array of the actual output 
-> line of code for testing 							 10 lines
