Here I use Javascript (Node Js) for coding the problem.

In order to solve this problem i first create a data.txt file which contain all the neccessary data required for this problem.
And then i create a data.js file where i first import path from path which is used to get all the paths needed for this program. And then i import file system (fs with promises) to perform operations related to the file system.

And after importing i then start coding all the logic needed for this project.Then i created a fileops function to handle all the operations. And i  will keep the output generated from the program in array. 

And for the test part i will first create a txt file which contains actual output for the file and create a testops function and use fs with promise to read the actual output and store it in array and check whether the output data of array and the actual output are same or not.

after analysing i came to the estimates
